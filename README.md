from_scratch
============

Creates a bsp tree for a given Geometry. Uses OpenGL for rendering.

The purpose of this project is to create a renderging engine for old school tactical rpg games
which used a first person perspective while moving and an isometric view during combats.

level_editor project is a level editor to create such maps, which then are inserted into the engine to create the bsp
tree.

Most recent branch is mapReader (need level_editor to compile).
