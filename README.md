from_scratch
============

This is a wannabe tile based dungeon crawler rpg game. For now it is a bare minimum 3d engine which creates a bsp tree for a given Geometry.
It uses the binary space partitioning information to create a Possible Visibility Set (PVS) from each tree leaf, in order to eliminate
rendering of non visible geometry at run time. Uses OpenGL for rendering.

Map information is loaded by reading two files located in the maps folder. map.txt (ASCII) which holds information about the map's tiles
and map.bsp (binary) which holds the map geometry. Both files are generated by the level_editor.
After generating the PVS a file name map.pvs (ASCII) will be created in the same folder. If this file already exists, PVS calculations are skipped.

[level_editor](https://github.com/hiddenbitious/level_editor) is a very simple level editor that can be used to create 2d maps.
3D geometry is generated from the 2D map which then is fed into the engine to generate the bsp tree.
